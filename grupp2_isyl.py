# 4. List Less Than Ten
# 	Take a list and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5. 1p
# 		a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list. 1p
# 	Write this in one line of Python.
# 	Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.
